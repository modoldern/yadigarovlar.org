                "The General Yadigarov brothers were from the village of Tekeli in Borchali.
                While in Borchali, most of the elders proudly stated that the Yadigarovs (Yadigaroğulları)
                were the founders of the village. For this reason, the village is often referred to as
                'Ağalıq' (Lordship/Estate)."
